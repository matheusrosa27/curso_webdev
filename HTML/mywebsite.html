    <h1>This page was made to talk about God of War: Ragnarok</h1>
    <p>As you can see, I don't know a lot about the game, but I know it has been postponed, why? Really don't know.</p>
    <p>But, there's no reason to hate the developers, Santa Monica or Sony, I think that's a good thing, because it'll give more time to the game be in it's prime gold.</p>
    <p>Below, there's a image of the game</p><br><br>
